warmup tasks:
    1. write a program that can print all the ODD numbers between 0 ~ 100 that can be divisible by 3 & 5

    2. write a program that can print all the EVEN numbers between 0 ~ 100 that can be divisible by 3 & 5

    3. write a program that can calculate the sum of all the even numbers between 1 ~ 100

    4. write a program that can calculate the sum of all the odd numbers between 1 ~ 100

    5. Write a program that will print out all letters in English alphabet in ascending order

    6. Write a program that will print out all letters in English alphabet in descedning order

    7. write a program that can calculate the sum of all numbers between 1 to any given number
        ex:
            input: 100
            output: 5050

            input: 50
            output: 1275

loop: repeated action

for:

        for(init; condition; iterator){
                statements;
        }


        initialization (mandatory): starting point

        condition (mandatory) : ending point

        iterator : Co-related to the condition
                    eventually make the condition false, so that it exits the loop





loop without curly brace: can ONLY repeat one statement. cannot have more than one statement in loops body



break statement: used for exiting switch and loops


continue statement: skips the current iteration

                    WE ONLY USE IT IN THE LOOP




Task:
    1. write a program that can reverse any string

    2. palindrome task

level ==> level ==> true

mom ==> mom  ==> true

muhtar ==> rathum ==> false


    3. print odd numbers between 1 to 50

    4. print even number between 1 to 50

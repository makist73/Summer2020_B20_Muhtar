				try{
					exception code
				}catch(ExceptionClass e){
						e.getMessage()
				}

		multi-catch block: parent exception class cannot be placed before child exception class

				Parent exception class can handle any child exceptions

				All exception classes that are extending RunTimeException are unchecked exception

				All exception classes that are not extending RunTimeException are checked exception


		finally block: always gets executed. even if the exception is not handled
						not mandatory


	2. throws: used for handling checked exception. indicates that method throws an exception
				MUST be used in method signature

				handles the exception temporary

				the caller of the method is responsible to handle the exception


throw keyword: manually throwing an exception, does not handle any exception
		
		object: new ExceptionClass();
		throw:
			throw objectOfException

Package name: day61_Maps


warmup tasks:
	1. write a program that can remove the palindrome string from a list of String
			DO NOT use Lambda expressions

	2. write a program that can remove the even numbers from a Set of Integers
			DO NOT use Lambda expressions

	3. write a program that can remove the duplicated Integers from a List of Integer
			Do Not change the insertion order


Data Structure:
		
	1. Array (fixed, accepts primitives & objects)
	2. Collection (dynamic, ONLY Objects)
	3. Map (dynamic, ONLY Objects )


Map: pair of data, accepts key & value.  does not support primitives. KEY is always unique
			KEY OF MAP CANNOT BE DUPLICATED, but value can be duplicated


Map methods:
	1. put(Key, Value): inserting key value to the map

	2. get(Key): returns the value of the key from the map

	3. remove(Key): removes the pair of data that's matching the key from the map

	4. containsKey(key): checks if the given key is contained in the map. returns boolean

	5. containsValue(Value): checks if the given value is contained in the map. returns boolean

	6. clear(): clears everything ==> size will be 0

	7. isEmpty(): boolean

	8. keySet(): returns all the keys from the map as Set

	9. values(): returns all the values from the map




1. create a map that can contain student name and score
		put 5 of your class mates names and thier score 
		print out the name of students who made less than 80


2. create a map that can contain the name of countries and thier capitals
			at least put 5 countries and thier capital city names in the map




next: 
	map continue: list of map
	enum
	garbage collector
	builder vs buffer

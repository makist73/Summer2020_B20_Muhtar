warmup tasks:
        create a class called Person
                attributes:  name, age, gender
                methods: eat, walk, sleep, setPersonInfo

        create a subclass of Person called Employee
                attributes: name, age, gender, Salary, ID, jobTitle

                        setInfo(), coding(),  fixBug(), toString()

        create a class called ScrumTeam
                    Attributes:
                            ArrayList<Tester> testers = new ArrayList<>(),
                            ArrayList<Developer> testers = new ArrayList<>(),
                    Actions:
                            addTester(Tester tester): adds the given tester to the testers arraylist
                            addTesters(Tester[] testers): adds the given testers to the testers arraylist
                            addDeveloper(Developer developer): adds the given developer to the developers arraylist
                            addDevelopers(Developer[] developers): adds the given developers to the developers arraylist
                            removeTester(long employeeID): removes the given tester from the testers arraylist
                            removeDeveloper(long employeeID): removes the developer from the developers arraylist
                            

        create a class called AppleInc:
                    1. create an array of Testers and store the testers info in your group
                    2. create an array of developers store the developers info in your group
                    3. create an object of ScrumTeam and store the testers & developers above to the scrum team

Has A vs Is A:
        
        ScreumTeam Has A Tester
        ScreumTeam Has A Developer

        Developer Is An Employee
        Developer IS A Person

        Employee Is A Person

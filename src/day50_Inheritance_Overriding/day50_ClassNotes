topic: Protected Access modifier
	   Method Overriding

Package name: day50_Inheritance_Overriding

warmup Task:
		1. create a class called Shape
						vairables: area, perimeter
						methods: calculateArea(), calculatePerimeter()

		2. create sub classes of Shape:
						Circle
						Rectangle
						Square

			 give the instance variables that are needed to calculate the Area, perimeter, of those shapes


	AFTER TODAY'S TOPIC:
		3. override super class' calculateArea(), calculatePerimeter() methods to the sub classes:

		 		Area of the circle:    3.14 * radius * radius
		 		Area of the rectangle:  width * length
		 		Area of the square:    side * side

		 		Perimeter of circle:   3.14 * 2 * radius
		 		Perimeter of rectangle: (width + length) * 2
		 		Perimeter of Square: 4 * side



Access modifiers:
	public: accessible at everywhere
	default: accessible within the package
	private: acccessible within the class

	protected: accessible to any class within the package, accessibe to subclasses outside package


	visibility:
		public > protected > default > private




method overloading: same method name , different parameter
					return-type can be same or different
					access modifier does not matter
					can be overloaded in same class




method overriding: same method name & same parameter
				   MUST happen in child class

	   why we need method overriding?
	   			to give different implementation to the method


		advantages: reusable
					less memory
					easy to memorize
					flexible

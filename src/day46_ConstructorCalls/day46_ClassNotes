Topic: Constructor Continue:
				Constructor calls ( this() )

	
Package name: day46_ConstructorCalls

this: 
	this.  : for instance variables and methods
	this(argument) : calls the constructor . can only be used in a constructor


Constructor calls:
		1. only the constructor can call another constructor
		2. constructor cannot be called by its name,  we need  this() 
		3. Constructor call MUST be at the first step
		4. one constructor can only call one constructor maximum
		5. Constructor cannot call or contain itself

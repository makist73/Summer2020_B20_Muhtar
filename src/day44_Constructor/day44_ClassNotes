class starts at 7:15 pm

package name: day44_Constructor


warmup task:
    1. Create a class called Employee
            instance variables: 
                    name, id, ssn, jobTitle, salary, gender

            static variables: 
            		isEmployeed, hasSalary

            actions:
                    setEmployeeInfo(): can initialize all the instance variables
                    toString(): can return the info of the employee as string

    2. create a class called HumanResources
            declare 5 variables of Employee as static
            use static block to:
                        1. initialize those static variables
                        2. set all the info of the Employees

    3. create class called BankOfAzerbaijan
        in the main method:
                1. create a List of Employees
                2. add random two employees from HumanResources to the List
                3. use for each loop to print out the employee name and salary



regular method:
		
		Access-Modifier Specifier ReturnType methodName(Parameters){
				statements;
		}


Constructor: very special method. used when we create the object of the class
			
			Every class  MUST have constructor. if we don't create one, compiler creates it for us (no-arg)

			execution depends on the creation of object


		   A                 obj         =   new           A();
		class name           obj name        keyword      Constructor


		declear:

			 Access-Modifier  className(Parameters){
			 		statements;	
			 }

			 name of constructor MUST be same with class name



	create object from class:
				ClassName	 obj = new ExistingConstructor




task: apply constructor instead of setInfo
	Dog:
		attributes:
			breed, size, age, gender, name...

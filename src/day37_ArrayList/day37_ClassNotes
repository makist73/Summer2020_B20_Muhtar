Package name: day37_ArrayList

Warmup Tasks:
		1. write a program that can find the unique characters from a string
		                DO NOT use nested loop
		                "ABABCDEE"
		                output: C D

		2. write a program that can find the frequency of character from a String
		                DO NOT use nested loop
		                "AABBCCDDEE"  ==> "ABCDE"
		                output: A2B2C2D2E2

Arrays Utility:
		Arrays.asList(): takes non-primitive array or array of values
					RETURNS COLLECTIONTYPE


ArrayList Methods:
		Bulk Operations: designed for CollectionTypes
				containsAll(ColectionType): verifies if all elements are contained in the list. boolean

				addAll(ColectionType): add multiple elements at the same time to arraylist

				removeAll(ColectionType): removes all the matching elements

				retainAll(ColectionType): removes all the NOT matching elements




		removeIf(Predicate): removes the elements that are matching with the if condition

				Predicate: applied to the CollectionTypes

						Predicate<DataType>	 name  =  p ->  Boolean Expression



Collections Class:
		Collections.frequency(ColectionType, Element): returns the frequency of element

		Collections.swap(ColectionType, index1, index2): swap the elements

		Collections.sort(ColectionType): sorts it in ascending order




		Collections.max(ColectionType): returns the maximum

		Collections.min(ColectionType): return the minimum

		Collections.replaceAll(ColectionType, old, value, new value):  replaces the old value with new given value



tasks:
	1. write a program that can remove all the names named 'Ahmed' from the list of names


	2. write a program that can remove the elements thta are not unique from the ArrayList

			NOTE:
				DO NOT USE:
						for loop
						while loop
						for each loop
						do-while


						list: {1,1,2,2,3,3,4,5,6,7}

						output: {4,5,6,7}




	3. write a program that can remove digits and letters for an ArrayList of characters

			list: {a,b,c,3,4,5,6,&,%,@,#,*}
			output: {&,%,@,#,*};



tasks:
	1. write a program that can return the duplicated elements from an arrayList of Integer
				Ex:
					list: {1,1,2,2,2,3,4,5,6}
					output: {1,1,2,2}

					DO NOT use loop




ArrayList methods:
	removeIf, removeAll, addAll, containAll, retianAll, equals, contains, get, set, indexOf, lastIndexOf



Arrays Class:
		asList

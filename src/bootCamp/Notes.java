    Java Bootcamp

    Practice topics:
                String: immutable object
                	StringBuilder & StringBuffer: mutable objects
                		Builder: not thread-safe
                		Buffer: thread-safe

                Loops: repeat
                	for:
                		for each:

                	while:

                	do-while

                Arrays: size is fixed
                		primitives & objects both supported
                		can be multi-dimensional


            		Wrapper Classs

                Arraylist: size is dynamic
                			Only supports objects


                Methods:

                Static & instance:
                		static: belong to Class
                				one copy

                				only accepts static

                		instance: belong to object
                				multiple copies


                Constructor & static block

                		constructor: used for creating object . initializing instance
                					execution depends on object


                		static block: initializing statics
                					only runs one time, before everything



                4 access modifiers:
                		private:
                		default:
                		protected:
                		public:
OOP: reusable
	 less memory
	 organized
	 easy to maintain


                OOP Encapsulation: hiding the data

                		getter (read)
                		setter (write)


                OOP Inheritance: IS A relation (super & sub classes), extends keyword

                Method Overriding: same method, different implementation
                					MUST happen in sub class
                					ONLY instance methods (non-static, private , final)
                					access modifier must eb same or more visible

                Final keyword
                OOP Abstraction
                OOP Polymorphism
                Exceptions & handling
                Collection

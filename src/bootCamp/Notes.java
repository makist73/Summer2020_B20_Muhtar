    Practice topics:
                String: immutable object
                	StringBuilder & StringBuffer: mutable objects
                		Builder: not thread-safe
                		Buffer: thread-safe

                Loops: repeat
                	for:
                		for each:

                	while:

                	do-while

                Arrays: size is fixed
                		primitives & objects both supported
                		can be multi-dimensional


            		Wrapper Classs

                Arraylist: size is dynamic
                			Only supports objects


                Methods:

                Static & instance:
                		static: belong to Class
                				one copy

                				only accepts static

                		instance: belong to object
                				multiple copies


                Constructor & static block

                		constructor: used for creating object . initializing instance
                					execution depends on object


                		static block: initializing statics
                					only runs one time, before everything



                4 access modifiers:
                		private:
                		default:
                		protected:
                		public:
OOP: reusable
	 less memory
	 organized
	 easy to maintain


                OOP Encapsulation: hiding the data

                		getter (read)
                		setter (write)


                OOP Inheritance: IS A relation (super & sub classes), extends keyword

                Method Overriding: same method, different implementation
                					MUST happen in sub class
                					ONLY instance methods (non-static, private , final)
                					access modifier must be same or more visible

                					same returntype, method name, parameter

    			method overloading: different methods with same name

    								same method name, different parameter


                Final keyword: constant

                OOP Abstraction: hiding the implementations of the method.

                			abstract methods: method without implementation

                			2 ways:
                				abstract class & Interface


                OOP Polymorphism: objects behaving in different forms

                	parent can be referenced to child class objects

                	Upcasting
                	Downcasting

                Exceptions & handling

                	try & catch & finally


                	throws: in method signature


                	throw: manually throwing exceptions


                Collection:  a data structure. dynamic sized

                	List: accepts duplicates, has index
                			ArrayList: array based class
                			LinkedList: doubly linked
                			Vector: synchronized, thread safe
                			Stack: synchronized, thread safe, LIFO

                			findElements

                	Set: does not accepts duplicates, does not have index
                			HashSet: can have null. order is not guaranteed
                			LinkedhashSet: can have null, insertion order
                			TreeSet: sorted order, does not accept null


                		getWindowHandles
                		getOptions()

            		Quque: accepts duplicates, does not have index, FIFO


        		Iterator: iterats the objects of collection
        				 used for remove method


                Map: pairs of data. Key & value. key cannot be duplicated
                		HashMap: can have a null key, order is not guaranteed
                		LinkedHashMap: can have a null key, insertion order
                		TreeMap: does not have null key, keys are sorted
                		HashTable: does not have null key, synchronized => thread-safe


                garbage collector

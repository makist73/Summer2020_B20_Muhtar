package name: day43_Static

static members:
		1. static variable
		2. static method
		3. static initializer block
		4. static class

local variable: declared within a block or method. cannot be used outsie its block
			    MUST be initialized before use

isntance variable: declared outside any methods or blocks

static variable: declared outside any methods or blocks with static keyword


static variable vs instance variable
		static variable: we only use it if one common feature can be shared by all objects of the class
						if we want all the objects to have the same data

		instance variable: we only use it if there is not one common feature, and each object need to have different copy
					if we want each object to have the unique data



static initializer block: runs first, runs once time only as soon as the class loaded
						used for initializing static variables


static import: imports the static variable and static method

		import.packageName.className;  // imports everything from class

		import static packageName.className.staticName;  //  imports the specific static member from the class

Package name: day12_Switch_Scanner

Warmup tasks:
    1. write a program that checks for the bigger of 3 numbers.
        you get 3 int variables: n1 , n2 and n3 (none of them are equal)

            if n1 is biggest output: "n1 is bigger"
            if n2 is biggest output: "n2 is bigger"
            if n3 is biggest output: "n3 is bigger"

            example:
                    n1 = -2
                    n2  = 2
                    n3  = 1
                output: "n2 is bigger"

            NOTE: DO NOT USE IF STATEMENT


    2. write a program that can define the age groups of a person
            age groups are:
                    Teenager (< 21)
                    Adult   (>=21 && <55 )
                    Senior  ( > 55 )

                  age cannot be negative or greater than 150

                  NOTE: MUST APPLY NESTED IF

switch statement:

        syntax:
            switch(expression){ // 1

                case caseValue1:
                            statementsA;
                            break;

                case caseValue2:
                            statementsA;
                            break;

                case caseValue2:
                            statementsA;
                            break;

                default:
                            statementsA;
                            break;

            }

            caseValue MUST match with switch statement's expression' data type
            caseValue MUST be unique

            which ever case is same with the expressions that' case will be executed

            default: gets executed if none of the cases are matching. can be placed at anywhere. not mandatory

            break: used for exiting bthe switch

            SWITCH DOES NOT ACCEPT: boolean, double, long, float values




task:
    write a program that can print out the name of the month based on the number
                ex:
                    1
                    output: "Jan"

                    DO NOT use if & ternary

    2. write a program that can find the number of days in a month
        (Assume that Feb has 28 days)
         HINT:
                28 days: 2
                30 days: 4,6,9,11
                31 days: 1,3,5,7,8,10,12
                invalid: month > 12 || months < 1


Scanner: used for to get user inputs

        presentedin package "java.util"

        syntax of import:
            import packageName.ClassName;  // imports a specific class

            import java.util.Scanner;


            import java.util.*;  // imports all the class from java.util

        import statement we need to place it between class name and package name



declare scanner:

        Scanner  variableName  = new  Scanner(System.in);


scanner' methods: reads the user input

    nextInt(): only allows user to enter integers. returns the input as int primitive

    nextLong(): only allows user to enter integers. returns the input as long primitive

    nextDouble(): can allow the user to enter decimals. returns the input as double primitive




Task:
    1. write a program that can ask user to enter a number
            if the number is odd number print: "odd number"
            otherwise, print: "Even"


    2. write a program that can ask youser to enter two number, and the prints the sum of those two number
            Enter your first number
            10
            Enter your second number
            20


    3. write a program for the rate calculator: RateCalculator
            1. asks the user to enter the salary (as double)
            2. asks the user how many hours does he/she works in a week (as int)
            3. print the hourly rate of the employee

            assume that one year has 52 weeks

            hourRate = salary/ (weeklyHour * 52)

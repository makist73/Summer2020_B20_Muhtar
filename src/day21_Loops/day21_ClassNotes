        Recap

        class starts at: 7:10pm

package name: day21_loops

Warmup tasks:
    1. write a program that asks user to enter 5 numbers and retuns the maximum number

    2. write a program that asks user to enter 5 numbers and returns the minimum number

    3. write a program that asks user to enter 5 numbers and returns the minimum number and maximum

    4. write a program that can divide two numbers without using / & % operators and retuns the devision and remainder
            ex:
                input:  10
                        3

                0utput: 3 with a remainder of 1

               10/3 = 3


               10 - 3 = 7
               7 - 3 = 4;
               4 - 3 = 1


do-while loop:

			do{
				statements

			}while(condition);



while vs do-while:

		when condition is false:
						do-while loop gets executed one time
						while loop NEVER gets executed
						for loop NEVER gets executed


branching statements:

	continue: can ONLY be used in loops
				jumps to the next iteration

	break: can ONLy be used in loops and switch
			exits the loop and switch

	system.exit(0):  anywhere
				terminates everything


1. Write a program that asks user to enter his/her username and password until user enters  correctly.
				there are only three attempts

				after three attempts:  lock the account

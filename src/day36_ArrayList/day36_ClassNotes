Topics: ArrayList Continue

class starts at: 7:10 pm

Package name: day36_ArrayList

warmup tasks:
	1. write a program that can set the last element of the Integer arraylist to zero
			ex:
				list = [1,2,3,4,5];
				output: [1,2,3,4,0];

	2. write a program that can multiply each odd number by 2
			ex:	list = [1,2,3,4,5];
				output: [2,2,6,4,10]

	3.  write a program that can find the unique elements from an ArrayList of integers and stores into another list called uniques

            ex: list==> {1,1,2,3,3,4,5}
                uniques ==> {2,4,5}


Data Structures:
		Array    ==> Arrays
		Collection ==> Collections


ArrayList methods:
	indexOf()
	lastIndexOf()
	contains()
	equals ()
	isEmpty()


Collections methods:

		Collections.sort(): sorts the arraylist in ascending order

		Collections.swap(ArrayList, index1, index2): swaps the elements of the given indexes

		frequency(ArrayList, Element): returns the frequency of the element from the arraylist



Methods short quiz due by 8:35 pm
under today's module



		"AABBCC"
		"ABC"



Task:
		1. write a program that can find the unique characters from a string
				DO NOT use nested loop

				"ABABCDEE"
				output: C D


		2. write a program that can find the frequency of character from a String
				DO NOT use nested loop

				"AABBCCDDEE"  ==> "ABCDE"
				output: A2B2C2D2E2

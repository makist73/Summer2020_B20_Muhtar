Topics: While & do-while loops

package name: day20_whileLoops

Warmup tasks:
    1. Write a program that calculates the sum of numbers entered by the user until user enters a negative number.
            hint: you need an infinite loop


    2. Write a program that can return the factorial number of any given number
        Ex:
            input: 5
            output: 120
            because: 5! = 5 * 4 * 3 * 2* 1 = 120


    3. write a program that can remove the duplicates from any given String
            Ex:
                input: abcabcaabb
                output: abc

loop: repeated action

while loop: repeated single if statement

            while(Condition){

                statement;

            }

branching statement:

    continue: skips the current iteration

    break: exits the loop

    System.exit(0): stops the entire program

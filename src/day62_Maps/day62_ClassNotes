Package name: day62_Maps


Last Warmup Tasks: 
		FrequencyOfChars
	1. Write a program that stores the the character and frequency of each character from a String in to a Map
    
	    Ex: 
	    	str = "aaabbbccb"

		    output:
		        {a=3, b=4, c=2}

	2. write a program that stores the unique characters from a string into a map
    
        Ex: 
        	str = "abacbdeef";

        	output:
            	{c=1, d=1, f=1}



Map Interface: Key & Value, cannot be primitive
		key MUST be unique

	HashMap (C): does not keep insertion order
				accepts null

	LinkedHashMap (C): keeps the insertion order
				accepts null

	HashTable (C): is synchronized, thread-safe
					does not accept null

	TreeMap (C): sorts the keys
			does not accept null



	methods of Map: put, getKey, isEmpty, remove, containskey&value, clear(), 

			KeySet(): returns the keys from map

			values(): returns the values from the map

			entrySet(): creates an Entry

					Entry<Key, Value>:
						getValue()
						getKey()



	Iterator interface is not applicable to Map, because Map does not have inherited relation with Iterable

garbage collection: process of removing unreferenced objects

finalize(): its's juts a method called by GC before the objects get collected. implictly done


final vs finally vs finalize:
		
		final: keyword, constant

		finally: block, try&catch&finally

		finalize: method, 



Collection: interface, data structure

Collections: class, utility class of Collection data structure



Enum: enumeration, a number things

	used for containing fixed set of constance
	
	we only need it if we need to take one out of small set of values



	String color = ""

	String weekDays = ""

	int num = ""

	String    browserName =


	Color: red, blue, yellow
	Direction: East, West, South, North
	Browsers: chrome, firefox, safari


	month: 1 ~ 12
	name of month: jan ~ dec


	int numOfMonth 
	String nameOfMonth = 


	Day: Mon, Tue, Wed, Thu, Fri, Sat, Sun
	Month: Jan ~ Dec
	Level: low, medium, high, chucknorries
	Planet: Earth, Moon, Mars, Jupiter



String: represents immutable version char sequences

StringBuilder: represents mutable version char sequences, not synchronized

StringBuffer:  represents mutable version char sequences, is synchronized ==> Thread-Safe

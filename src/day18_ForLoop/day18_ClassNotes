Warmup tasks
1. write a program that asks user's first and last name, then prints out the initials of the user

                input:
                    cybertek
                    batch18

                output:

        DO NOT use charAt method

2. write a program that can reverse the following string:

                output: avaJ

            please provide two solutions:
                        first solution, you MUST use substring method
                        second solution, you MUST use charAt method

3. write a program that will return the domain of an email address:
            Ex:
                input: test@gmail.com
                output: the domain of the email is: gmail

Canvas -> Java -> modules -> day18 -> String short quiz

loops: repeated statement


for loop: only gets executed if the condition is true
		  stops when condition is false

		for(initialization; Condition; Iterator ){

                statements;

		}


		initialization: starting point
					int i = 0;

		condition: ending point, based on initialization
				i == 0;
				i < 100;
				...

		Iterator: Co-related to the condition. MUST be capable enough to make the condition false



		tasks:
			1. write a program that can print all even numbers between 0 ~ 1000
			2. write a program that can print all odd numbers between 0 ~ 1000
			3. write a program that can print a~z
			4. write a program that can print A~Z

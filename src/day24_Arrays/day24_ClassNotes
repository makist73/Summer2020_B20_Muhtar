        for each loop

package name: day24_Arrays

warmup tasks:
    1. write a program that can find the unique characters from a String
        Ex:
            input: aabccd
            output: bd

    2. write a program that asks user how many numbers he wants to enter, and get all the user inputs and store them into an array variable,then  return maximum and minimum numbers

    3. Write a program that can return the average number from an array of integers
            ex:
                [1,2,3]
                average: 2

                [10, 15, 5, 6]
                average: 9

                [4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 10, 20, 30, 0]
                average: 10



                10/3  ==> 3
                10/3.0 ==> 3.333

                10/(double)3  == > 3.333...



Arrays Utility:

        Arrays class: presented in "java.util" package

            import java.util. Arrays ;


           Arrays.toString(arr):  converts array value to string
                                WE ONLY NEED IT TO PRINT THE ARRAY VARIABLE ITSELF

           Arrays.sort(arr): sorts the array in ascending order

           Arrays.equals(arr1, arr2): retunrs boolean


String methods:

        String str = "ABCDE";

        toCharArray(): returns char array.

            str.toCharArray() ==>  ['A', 'B', 'C', 'D', 'E']


        split(value): retunrs String Array, splits the string by given valie

            String sentence = "Java is cool"

                    sentence.split(" ") ==> ["Java", "is", "cool"]

Data Structures:
        1. Array
        2. Collection
        3. Map


int[] arr = {1,2,3};

    for(int i= 0; i <= arr.length-1; i++){

    }


for each loop: a loop that's already iterated.  starting from index 0 till the end of data structure

                order is fixed.

                we MUST have a data structure to use for each


                for(DataType  each : Collection Of Data ){

                }

                    each: represents every single elemnts in collection
                            IS NOT INDEX NUMBER


                    DataType: MUST match with Array's dataType




Task:
    1. write a program that can print out the unique numbers from an array of integers

    Ex:
        int[] arr ={1,1,2,3,3,4}

        output:
            2 4

    2. write a program that can find the unique words from an array of string



ASSIGNMENT:
    3. write a program that can combine two arrays of integers and then print out the maximum number

    Ex:
        arr1 = { 1,2,3,4}
        arr2 = {5,6,7,8}

        output:
            arr3 = {1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8}
            max: 8

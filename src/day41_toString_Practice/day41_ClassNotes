package: day41_Static

warmup tasks:
	1. create a custom class for the Carpet class that should contain the following:

                instance variables:
                        width, length, unitPrice, isPersian (boolean)

                instance methods:
                        customOrder(): sets the carpet' width, length, unitprice, & isParsian
                        calcCost(): should be able to caculate the total cost of the carpet and return it as double
                        getCarpetInfo(): should be able to display all the info of the carpet including the total cost of the carpet as calculated by calcCost()

            total price of carpet= (width*length)*unitprice

            if the carpet is persian  carpet that's came from Turkey, add 200$ to the totalPrice




            create a class called carpetObjects, and create an array of the carpet that contains 5 carpet objects ( make sure you set the instance variables of those objets)

            create two ArrayList of carpets:
                                        persianCarpets
                                        reugularCarpets

            write a program to store all the persian Carpets into the list of persianCarpets, and store all regular carpets into the list of reugularCarpets

                    use for each loop to print out all the persian carpets



Local Variables: declared within the block method
				cannot use it outside the method
				MUST be initialized before use

instance variables: declared outside any methods



this. : for object Instances ONLY
		when the instance and local has the same names.



toString method: it's an instance method, used when we print the object of object name
				MUST be called when we print object and object name
				implicitly called by compiler


				return-type: String



Task:
	Cat:
		attributes:
				name, age, gender, color, breed

		Actions:
				setInfo, eat, drink, toString

				use this. keyword

	Make sure that you can print out the objects of the Cat in the print statement




	CatObjects:
			create 5 objects of Cat and store them into an array variable

			print out the informations of every single cat
					(DO NOT use getInfo method)



			ArrayList:
				maleCats
				femaleCats

				first approach: apply loop ( both for each loop and for loop)
				second approach: do not use loop


multi-classes: we can create as many classes as we want within one java file,
				THERE CAN ONLY BE ONE PUBLIC CLASS.
				PUBLIC CLASS' NAME MUST BE SAME WITH FILE NAME


Tomorrow: static
		  static vs instance
